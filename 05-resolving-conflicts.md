:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How to solve conflicts in code?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Rebasing your working branch to a recent updates in the default branch
- Solving conflicting edits in files
- Defining best practices for contributions
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Enter panic mode!

Everybody is frantically working on the same code. The owner commits straight to the default branch, developers push from their own branches… and soon, conflicts explode.

To keep the battle on the code — not between people — we’ll practice breaking things on purpose and then fixing them.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- If the use of automated workflows is planned, it is convenient to work in a shared repository instead of using forks.
- You will use branches to contribute to the shared repository (unless you are the owner or the maintainer).
